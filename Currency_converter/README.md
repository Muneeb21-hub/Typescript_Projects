## Code Overview

The Currency Converter is implemented using TypeScript and the `axios` and `inquirer` libraries for API requests and user input, respectively. Here's a brief overview of how the code works:

- The program makes an API request to get the latest exchange rates from `https://api.exchangerate-api.com`.
- Users input the amount, source currency code, and target currency code through the command-line interface provided by the `inquirer` library.
- The `convertCurrency` function calculates the converted amount based on the exchange rates.
- The main function handles user interactions and error handling.

Feel free to explore the code and customize it as you see fit. You can enhance the app by adding more currency-related features and error handling.
